"# Count_goods_using_ir_sensor" 
you can run this code in pic18f4620 using bootloader and this code implement an ir_sensor with buzzer connected to a pic18f4620 that detict every move and turn on the buzzer and theres is a counter must be increment every move and you can see the result on lcd 16*2 that connected to the pic microcontroller in this picture i well explain thhe project :


1-when sensor didnot  detict any thing :
